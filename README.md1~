# Grades React App

[Live App](https://grades-app-c415d.ey.r.appspot.com/)

### Description:
An end-to-end GPA Calculator And More Web App, using React for the frontend, Node + Express for the backend and mongoDB for the database.

### About The Project:
I wanted to do this since I`ve started to learn 'react', It was a great exercise, mainly on the frontend UI.

Data for this website built by the users themselves, users can input their grades by their credits and semesters and recieve data about their academic experience,
such as GPA (overall/yearly/semesterly), how many users from their academic instituition are using this app and what is their average GPA. in addition they can see
how they are doing in their academic instituition. lastly, users can edit grades or add new courses in order to plan their future.

The project was deployed with Google Cloud web hosting service.
